"""
A flying of an aircraft can be simply explained through 4 forces:
lift, weight, thrust, and drag. Lift is a force pushing an aircraft up
against weight. Write a program to estimate a power to fly a plane:
ask a user to input (1) drag coefficient CD, (2) lift coefficient CL,
(3) air density rho, (4)  plane cross-section area A, (5) wing area S,
and (6) plane weight m, then calculate speed v to sustain the flight altitude
and power required to fly in such a condition and report it.
Note: (1) power = thrust * v; (2) thrust ~= drag (at constant speed);
(3) drag = CD (0.5 rho v^2) A; (4) at constant flight altitude
lift = weight; (5) weight = m g and g = 9.8 m/s^2;
and (6) lift = CL (0.5 rho v^2) S.
